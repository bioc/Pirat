\usage{

  data.pep.rna.crop,
  psi,

}
\arguments{
\item{data.pep.rna.crop}{A list representing dataset, with mRNA normalized counts and mRNA/PGs adjacecy table.}

\item{psi}{Inverse scale parameter for IW prior of peptides abundances}

\item{psi_rna}{Inverse scale parameter for IW prior of mRNA abundances}

\item{rna.cond.mask}{Vector of size equal to the number of samples in mRNA abundance table, 
containing indices of conditions of each sample.}

\item{pep.cond.mask}{Vector of size equal to the number of samples in peptide abundance table, 
containing indices of conditions of each sample.}

\item{pep_ab_or}{In case we impute a dataset with pseudo-MVS, we can provide the ground truth abundance table, 
such that imputation will by done only for pseudo-MVs. This will accelerate imputation algorithm.}

\item{df}{Estimate degree of freedom of the IG distribution fitted on observed variance.}

\item{nu_factor}{Multiplication factor on degree of freedom. 2 by default.}

\item{max_pg_size}{Maximum PGs size authorized for imputation. PG size is plitted if its size is above this threshold.}

\item{max.pg.size2imp}{Maximum PG size to impute after splitting. PGs for which size is greater are not imputed. Should be lower than max_pg_size to have effect.}

\item{...}{xxx}

\item{prot.idxs}{Vector of indices of PGs to impute}
}
\value{
A list containing imputation results for each PG, the execution time, and adjacency matrix between peptides and PGs corresponding to the imputed PGs.
}
\description{
Imputes each PG separately accounting for transcriptomic dataset and returns the results for each PG.
